        "Experiment": "Introduce a covariance penalty term in the loss function that encourages the covariance matrix of the latent vectors to be close to the identity matrix. This can be implemented by adding a term to the loss that penalizes the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the latent vectors. Modify the `train` method to include this additional regularization term in the loss computation.",

Define TSL as the L2 norm of the difference between consecutive pen movements. Modify the `train` method to include TSL in the loss computation. Implement an adaptive weighting mechanism that adjusts the influence of TSL based on the variance of pen movements within a sequence. Evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated sketches with and without TSL.",

        "Experiment": "In this experiment, we introduce an attention mechanism to the decoder RNN. This involves adding an attention layer that computes a context vector at each decoding step by taking a weighted sum of the latent representations. The context vector is concatenated with the decoder's hidden state and the current input to generate the next output. Modify the `DecoderRNN` class to include the attention mechanism and adjust the `forward` method accordingly. Evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated sketches with and without the attention mechanism.",

        "Experiment": "Develop a model that captures user interaction features such as pen pressure, tilt, and velocity in real-time during both training and sketch generation phases. This involves creating custom preprocessing steps to collect interaction data from users during training sessions, which are then used for feature extraction and integration into the loss function and sampling process within the neural network architecture. The result is a model that not only generates diverse sketches but also adapts its outputs based on each user's unique interactive patterns.",

Implement a two-fold approach: first, pre-train the model on identifying and simulating these unconventional biases based on user interaction data; second, during generation, introduce dynamic adjustments in the generative process that resonate with the identified bias patterns to enhance personalization and engagement.",
