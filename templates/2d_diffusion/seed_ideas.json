    "Experiment": "This experiment involves training diffusion models with identical hyperparameters but using different architectures (e.g., U-Net, DDPM) across a variety of datasets that vary in complexity and characteristics. The evaluation will be based on the average KL divergence across all models for each dataset to determine which architecture is most effective at generalizing performance under diverse conditions.",
